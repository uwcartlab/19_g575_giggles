          <p> Although Native Americans benefitted from access to new technology and trade, 
            the disease and thirst for land which the early settlers also brought posed a serious challenge to the Native American's long-established way of life.

          <h2>Powhatan War</h2>
          <p>
            One of the first Native American uprisings occurred in Virginia in 1622, when some 347 whites were killed, including a number of missionaries who had just recently come to Jamestown.
            Local tribes tried to prevent settlement of the Connecticut River region.

          <h2>King Philip's War</h2>
          <p>
            In 1675 Phillip, the son of the chief who had made the original peace with the Pilgrims in 1621, attempted to unite the tribes of southern New England against further European encroachment of their lands.
            In the struggle, however, Phillip lost his life and many Native Americans were sold into servitude.

          <h2>Thinning The Barbarous Indian Nations</h2>
          <p>
              The governor of North Carolina ascribes the “thinning of Indians” by disease to the “hand of God . . .eminently seen.”
