        <h1>What is human trafficking? </h1>
        <p>Human trafficking is a form of modern day slavery<sup>5</sup> and a capitalization on an individual's vulnerability. Formally, it is:</p>
        <ul>The <b>recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining</b> of a person for <b>labor or services</b>, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of <b>subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery</b>; </ul>
        <ul>and/or </ul>
        <ul><b>Sex trafficking</b> in which a commercial sex act is <b>induced by force, fraud, or coercion</b>, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age.<sup>2</sup></ul>
      </section>

        <p>The story we are telling here is not one of where human trafficking is necessarily <i>happening</i>, but of where and how people like you are <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/indicators-human-trafficking" target="_blank">recognizing the signs</a> of potential human trafficking occurrences and reporting them by making calls to the <a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/" target="_blank">National Human Trafficking Hotline</a>.

        <p>4,522 of these calls were from victims and survivors. 4,905 were from individuals who noticed and reported on potential signs of trafficking, including 2,387 cases involving minors. 638 of these calls were to request crisis assistance.<sup>5</sup> <br><br><b style="font-size:20px">Each of these dots is a <span class="highlight">call for help</span>. </b></p><br>

        <p>There are an estimated <b>45.8 million people</b> held in slavery today. <b>57,700</b> of these people live within the U.S.<sup>6</sup>—a number just short of the entire population of Dubuque, Iowa, or enough people to overflow—by 15,000 people—Miller Park.<sup>7</sup> <br><br>Imagine all ticketholders and 15,000 others crowded onto the field of Miller Park being forced into slavery. These would be victims of <b>human trafficking</b>. And, unfortunately, these estimates do not reflect the true number of victims suffering in our modern world, including in every single U.S. state. <br><br> In fact, Polaris estimates that the number of human trafficking victims in America is in actuality in the <em><span class="highlight">hundreds of thousands</span></em>.<sup>8</sup></p>

        <h2 id="amber"><em>Amber* was a victim of human trafficking in the United States.</em></h2>
        <p>Amber, a mother with cognitive disabilities, lived with her cousin in St. Louis, Missouri. She was persuaded by two adult sisters to move in with them. The sisters had promised to take care of Amber and to help her to get her children back. Instead, they forced Amber into slavery, claiming that Amber must repay her own cousin’s contrived debt to one of the sisters. The sisters had threatened to hurt Amber’s mother and grandmother if she did not comply.<br><br>The sisters began stealing Amber’s monthly social security disability check. Amber was forced into prostitution on the street. She was also forced to do housework and suffered unspeakable acts of abuse from the sisters and another housemate. These crimes were hidden from the police on multiple occasions over several months.<sup>9</sup> <br><br>In 2009, officers from the St. Louis Metro Police Department discovered Amber tied up in the garage. One of the sisters—as the primary perpetrator—claims to have been subjected to the same treatment by her own mother, and has lived in a world of drugs, abuse, and her own mental challenges since childhood. The three perpetrators were sentenced to a total amounting to 27.25 years to be spent in prison after pleading guilty.<sup>10</sup><br><br><small><i> *Name is a pseudonym</i><a href="https://www.unodc.org/cld/case-law-doc/traffickingpersonscrimetype/usa/2005/united_states_v._wallace.html?lng=en&tmpl=htms" target="_blank"> (Case USA162)</a></small></p>

        <div class="questions">
          <p>Each of our lives is touched by it, every single day, through the businesses we support, the products we purchase, and our daily habits. Human trafficking is a <em>market-driven criminal industry, fueled by a demand for cheap labor, services, and for commercial sex</em>.<sup>4</sup> </p>
          <p>From the enslavement and abuse of a modestly estimated 21,000,000 (21 million) people worldwide, including the U.S. 3, in 2014 the forced labour industry alone made an estimated:
            <ul style="list-style-type:none">
              <li><b>$150,000,000,000</b> (150 billion) of illegal profits worldwide</li>
              <li><b>$99,000,000,000</b> (99 billion) from commercial sexual exploitation + </li>
              <li><b>$51,000,000,000</b> (51 billion) from forced economic exploitation:

                  <li><i>$8,000,000,000</i>  (8 billion) saved by private households by not paying or underpaying domestic workers held in forced labour. </li>

        <p>Ending human trafficking requires constant vigilance, and legislation supporting this vigilance is not only essential but requires government funding to be successfully implemented. Require that your legislators represent your needs as well as the needs of the “invisible” victims of human trafficking. The U.S. government continues to make progress in addressing the prosecution, protection, and prevention of trafficking, and needs to continue to do so (for a list of recent actions and recommendations, see the <a href="https://paei.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2016/index.htm" target="_blank">2016 Trafficking In Persons Report</a>). </p>

Highlighted as one of 10 non-profits "making a difference" by U.S. News and World Report, <a href="https://www.ijm.org/" target="_blank">the International Justice Mission</a>—the largest anti-trafficking organization in the world—is one of the many where your dollars truly do make a difference. </p>
